<p>Hello!</p>

<p>My name is Alex Hussar, and I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology under the guidance of 
  Professor Santosh Pande. My research interests include static analysis, dynamic analysis, symbolic execution, and software exploitation. My educational background 
  consists of a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the University of the Pacific in Stockton, CA, and a Master of Computer Science (MCS) from the 
  University of California, Irvine.

  Before starting my Ph.D., I gained experience as a Cybersecurity Engineer (more specifically, an Information 
  Systems Security Engineer, or ISSE) at an Electronic Defense Company. I specialized in securing large interconnected 
  systems during my three years in this role. This role furthered my interest in Cybersecurity, software assurance, and digital infrastructure integrity. Currently, I am a full-time 
  researcher at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) within the Software Assurance branch, where I'm dedicated to advancing the field of software 
  security and analysis.

  On a more personal note, I've always been an enthusiast for physical activity and sports. During my time at the University of the Pacific, 
  I was a D1 soccer player and had the privilege of captaining the team. Though my soccer journey took 
  an unexpected turn due to injury, I've become more involved in CrossFit and its community. Today, I actively engage in local CrossFit competitions and serve 
  as a CrossFit Coach at a local gym here in Atlanta. Outside my professional and fitness pursuits, I share my life with two dogs and a husband.
