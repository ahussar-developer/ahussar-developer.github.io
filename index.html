Welcome to my personal website, where I'm excited to share both my professional journey and a glimpse into my personal interests. As a dedicated researcher, I'm currently immersed in the world of cybersecurity, with a focus on static analysis, dynamic analysis, symbolic execution, and software exploitation. My educational background includes a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from the University of the Pacific in Stockton, CA, and a Master of Computer Science (MCS) from the University of California, Irvine. Presently, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science at the Georgia Institute of Technology under the guidance of Professor Santosh Pande, delving deeper into the fascinating realms of computer science.

Before embarking on my Ph.D. journey, I gained valuable hands-on experience as a Cybersecurity Engineer with a specific title of Information Systems Security Engineer (ISSE) at an Electronic Defense Company. During my three years in this role, I specialized in securing large interconnected systems, a role that further ignited my passion for ensuring the utmost security and integrity of digital infrastructure. Currently, I am a full-time researcher at the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) within the Software Assurance branch, where I'm dedicated to advancing the field of software security and analysis.

On a personal note, I've always been an enthusiast for physical activity and sports. During my time at the University of the Pacific, I not only excelled academically but also served as a D1 soccer player and had the privilege of captaining the team. Though my soccer journey took an unexpected turn due to injury, I've channeled my passion into Crossfit. Today, I actively engage in local Crossfit competitions and proudly serve as a Crossfit Coach at a gym right here in Atlanta. Outside of my professional and fitness pursuits, I share my life with two beloved dogs who bring joy and companionship into my daily routine. Thank you for visiting my website, and I look forward to sharing more about my journey with you.
